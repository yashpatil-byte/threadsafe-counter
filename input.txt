Hi, I'm Yash Patil.

I'm a Computer Science master's student at Northeastern University, Boston.
Currently, I'm preparing for Software Development Engineer (SDE) roles,
focusing on building strong foundations in algorithms, systems, and Python.

This file is used for testing file I/O operations in Python — 
reading, writing, copying, and measuring performance.

Let’s see how the OS handles this behind the scenes!
HELLLLOOOOOOO
